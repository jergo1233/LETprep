    <h1 style="color: orange;">Motivation in Board Exam Review</h1>
    <p><b>
      Motivation is very important for a person who is reviewing for a board examination.
      Reviewing for a board exam requires time, effort, and discipline.
      Without strong motivation, a reviewee may feel tired, distracted, or lose focus easily.
      Motivation gives a person the reason to continue studying even when the topics are difficult or when the pressure becomes high.
      <br><br>
      There are different sources of motivation during board exam preparation.
      Some people are motivated by personal goals, such as becoming a licensed professional or helping their family.
      Others are motivated by external factors like passing the exam, getting a job, or achieving success.
      <br><br>
      Maintaining motivation throughout the review period is a challenge, but it is necessary for success.
      In the end, strong motivation helps a person stay focused, overcome difficulties, and succeed in the board examination.
